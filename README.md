## Recommendation

**- Marketing Strategy for Repeat Customers**
  Utilize the fact that 97.12% of customers make repeat purchases by creating appealing loyalty programs, such as     
  special discounts or exclusive offers for future purchases.
  Develop marketing campaigns targeting the 55+ age group, as they represent the largest customer segment (30.20%). 
  Use marketing channels most popular with this age group, such as email or social media platforms they frequently 
  use.
**- Optimize Sales for Most Frequently Ordered Products**
  Focus on promoting and offering special deals for clothing, as it is the most frequently ordered product.
  Review annual sales strategies considering that books and clothing alternate as top-selling products. Aggressively
  promote these items during peak sales seasons.
  
**- Customer Segmentation Based on Value**
  For top customers (active-frequent-high value), offer exclusive programs such as premium memberships, early access    to new products, or special events. These customers purchase an average of 19 times, spend around $51,987, and made 
  their last purchase within the past 8 days.
  Provide incentives to increase purchase frequency for active-regular-high value customers who buy an average of 7 
  times and spend about $18,468. Consider bundling offers or additional discounts for large purchases.
  For inactive-regular-high value customers who have purchased 6 times in 289 days, spending an average of $17,423, 
  consider retargeting campaigns to reactivate them. Offer exclusive discounts or special deals to encourage them to 
  return.
